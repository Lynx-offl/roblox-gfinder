# roblox-group-scanner-v2
Python 3 tool for finding unclaimed groups on Roblox. Supports multi-threading, multi-processing and HTTP proxies.

Unlike [roblox-group-scanner](https://github.com/h0nde/roblox-group-scanner), this tool uses the batch endpoint for group details, thus resulting in performance speed-ups of up to 100x.
